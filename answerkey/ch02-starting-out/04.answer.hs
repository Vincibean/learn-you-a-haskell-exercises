{-
 - Duplicate the elements in list xs, for example "duplicate [1,2,3]" would give the list [1,1,2,2,3,3]
 - Hint: The "concat [l]" function flattens a list of lists into a single list.
 - (You can see the function definition by typing ":t concat" into the interpreter. Perhaps try this with other variables and functions)
 -
 - For example: concat [[1,2,3],[3,4,5]] returns [1,2,3,3,4,5]

duplicate xs = concat [[x, x] | x <- xs]
