-- This is not recursive, but have a go anyway.
-- Create a function which takes two parameters, a number and a step
-- The result is the sign of the original number reversed, and the step added to the absolute value
-- Confused? Some examples: stepReverseSign 6 2 = -8
--			    stepReverseSign -3 1 = 4
--			    stepReverseSign 1 2 = -3
stepReverseSign :: (Fractional a, Ord a) => a -> a -> a
stepReverseSign num step = ((if num > 0
                        then -1
                        else 1) * (abs(num) + step))
