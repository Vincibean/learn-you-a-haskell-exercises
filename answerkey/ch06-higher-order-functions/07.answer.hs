-- Create a new higher order method which generalises over the function provided by sumInts (That is, parameterize (+) :: Int -> Int -> Int) between a and b
-- This will give the ability to perform utilities such as the prodcut of all squares (or any other Int -> Int function) between a and b
-- You will also need to generalise the base case
-- You can also define the function signature yourself, which leaves you free to define the parameters and their order
-- To be clear, your function will need to handle:
--  - A start value, a :: Int
--  - A end value, b :: Int
--  - A function to apply to each value, op :: Int -> Int
--  - A function to apply between each value, f :: Int -> Int -> Int
--  - A value to return in the base case when a > b, z :: Int
